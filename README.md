Mathematical Base Defense is a educational game about making math equations to destroy enemies while protecting your base in the process.

Anyone is open to contribute to Mathematical Base Defense. (you might also be rewarded)!

NOTICE: This project is a submission to NSC 2021, which is ran by the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA).

## Installation

Download the files, and then run the executable INSIDE THE FOLDER IT'S IN (you only have to do this for each first launch for each version).

## Use

You are to form expressions that match atleast one of the numbers above the enemies before they reach your base.
Doing so awards you points, the number of points according to how far the enemy is from the base, and how long your expression is.
